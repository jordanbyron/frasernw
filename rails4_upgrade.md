Method changes and similar core changes:
- [x] mass-assignment protection deprecated in favour of strong params **for now, just check that gem-enabled legacy code still works; with protected_attributes gem, this becomes only deprecation-level urgency**
   - [x] **Rails 4.0 has removed `attr_accessible` and `attr_protected` feature in favor of Strong Parameters. You can use the [Protected Attributes gem](https://github.com/rails/protected_attributes) for a smooth upgrade path.**
   - [x] If you are not using Protected Attributes, you can remove any options related to this gem such as `whitelist_attributes` or `mass_assignment_sanitizer` options.
- [x] scopes must always use callables [see commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/50cbc03d18c5984347965a94027879623fc44cce)
- [x] routes
   - [x] `match` can't be used anymore
   - [x] you will need to make a change if you are using `form_for` to update a resource in conjunction with a custom route using the `PUT` HTTP method [see 5.1](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0) **modified all custom routes using `PUT` to `PATCH`**
   - [x] relatedly, `json_patch`
- [x] Thread safe by default. Check that the gems you are using are threadsafe. **very hard to be sure, but doesn't look like a problem for us**
   - [x] `config.threadsafe!` is deprecated in favor of `config.eager_load`
- [x] Strings rendered in erb are escaped unless wrapped with `raw` or `html_safe` is called. **we don't use erb**
- [x] `Rails::Plugin` has gone **not used**
- [x] Active Support
   - [x] Replace deprecated `memcache-client` gem with `dalli` in `ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore`
   - [x] `Object#try` will now return `nil` instead of raise a `NoMethodError` if the receiving object does not implement the method, but you can still get the old behavior by using the new `Object#try!`.
   - [x] `String#to_date` now raises `ArgumentError: invalid date` instead of `NoMethodError: undefined method 'div' for nil:NilClass` when given an invalid date. It is now the same as `Date.parse`, and it accepts more invalid dates [see 9](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html)
   - [x] Rails 4.0 removes the `j` alias for `ERB::Util#json_escape` **we don't use**
- [x] `ActiveRecord`
   - [x] Remove `IdentityMap` **never used**
   - [x] Remove automatic execution of `EXPLAIN` queries. The option `active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds` is no longer used and should be removed.
   - [x] In Rails 3 you could use `Model.scoped` to return Rails’s relation of all Model’s objects. In Rails 4 `.all` returns Rails Relation by default **not used**
   - [x] When a column or a table is renamed the related indexes are also renamed. If you have migrations which rename the indexes, they are no longer needed. **not used**
   - [x] Changed `serialized_attributes` and `attr_readonly` to class methods only. You shouldn't use instance methods since it's now deprecated. You should change them to use class methods, e.g. `self.serialized_attributes` to `self.class.serialized_attributes`. **not used**
   - [x] When using the default coder, assigning `nil` to a serialized attribute will save it to the database as `NULL` instead of passing the `nil` value through `YAML ("--- \n...\n")`.
   - [x] Rails 4.0 has changed to default join table for `has_and_belongs_to_many` relations to strip the common prefix off the second table name. Any existing `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship between models with a common prefix must be specified with the `join_table` option. [see 5.4](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0) **already done!**
      - [x] Note that the prefix takes scopes into account as well, so relations between `Catalog::Category` and `Catalog::Product` or `Catalog::Category` and `CatalogProduct` need to be updated similarly. **there are none**
- [x] `ActiveModel`
   - [x] Changed how errors attach with the `ActiveModel::Validations::ConfirmationValidator`. Now when confirmation validations fail, the error will be attached to `:#{attribute}_confirmation` instead of `attribute`. **not used**
   - [x] Changed `ActiveModel::Serializers::JSON.include_root_in_json` default value to `false`. [See 5.6](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0) **commented out wrap_parameters config**
- [x] `ActiveRecord::Observer` and `ActionController::Caching::Sweeper` have been extracted to the `rails-observers` gem **installed gem**
- [x] ActionPack
   - [x] [See 5.7 long note on `ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator` regarding setting `secret_key_base`](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0)
   - [x] Removed the `ActionController::Base.asset_path` option. Use the assets pipeline.
   - [x] Removed Action and Page caching from Action Pack. You will need to add the `actionpack-action_caching` gem in order to use `caches_action` and the `actionpack-page_caching` to use `caches_pages` in your controllers.
   - [x] Removed the XML parameters parser. You will need to add the `actionpack-xml_parser` gem if you require this feature.
   - [x] Changes the default layout lookup set using symbols or procs that return `nil`. To get the "no layout" behavior, return `false` instead of `nil`.
   - [x] Changes the default `memcached` client from `memcache-client` to `dalli`. To upgrade, simply add gem '`dalli`' to your `Gemfile`. **already using `dalli`**
   - [x] Changed how `assert_generates`, `assert_recognizes`, and `assert_routing` work. Now all these assertions raise `Assertion` instead of `ActionController::RoutingError`.
   - [x] Raises an `ArgumentError` if clashing named routes are defined. This can be triggered by explicitly defined named routes or by the resources method. **yup**
   - [x] Changed the way unicode character routes are drawn. Now you can draw unicode character routes directly. If you already draw such routes, you must change them. [See 5.7, halfway down](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0) **not used**
   - [x] Removed `ActionDispatch::BestStandardsSupport` middleware, `<!DOCTYPE html>` already triggers standards mode per [standard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj676915(v=vs.85).aspx) and ChromeFrame header has been moved to `config.action_dispatch.default_headers`.
   - [x] Precompiling assets no longer automatically copies non-JS/CSS assets from `vendor/assets` and `lib/assets`. Rails application and engine developers should put these assets in `app/assets` or configure `config.assets.precompile`.
   - [x] Configure asset pipeline. See [section 9, at bottom](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)
   - [x] `ActionController::UnknownFormat` is raised when the action doesn't handle the request format. By default, the exception is handled by responding with `406 Not Acceptable`, but you can override that now. In Rails 3, `406 Not Acceptable` was always returned. No overrides. **acceptable**
   - [x] A generic `ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::ParseError` exception is raised when `ParamsParser` fails to parse request params. You will want to rescue this exception instead of the low-level `MultiJson::DecodeError`, for example.
   - [x] `SCRIPT_NAME` is properly nested when engines are mounted on an app that's served from a URL prefix. You no longer have to set `default_url_options[:script_name]` to work around overwritten URL prefixes. **N/A**
- [x] Do we rely on Helpers loading order? **no** [see 5.9](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-3-2-to-rails-4-0)
