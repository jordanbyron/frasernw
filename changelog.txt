## [2015-06-08] [Since April 27, 2015 User Update]

### Added:
- CR:  Added support for custom labels so that specialties can be referred to with names other than "Specialist" (e.g. Nurse Practitioners, Midwives, Family Physician).
- CR, Local-only:  Purchased SSL Certificate, added SSL (https://), all requests are now encrypted and redirect to https://pathwaysbc.ca.
- ENV["FORCE_SSL"] can be set to "true" or "false" as an environment variable to enable or disable SSL.
- CR:  Added major upgrade to analytics system; CSV report tools now allow fetching comprehensive division-specific usage analytics and entity metrics.
- Added a heartbeat loading animation in between periods where a user is waiting for their browser to render HTML.
- Add indexes and update database queries for content items (providing a measured ~150ms boost to page speed loads).

### Changed
- Renamed "Areas of Practice" to "Accepts Referrals For" where appropriate.
- Specialty pages now load much faster (~1 to ~2 seconds) due to replacing hide/show table filtering with a table filtering system that destroys/recreates table rows on each filter.
- User edit form now warns admins if a user is missing a division.
- Upgrade to Rails 3.2 now fully complete.
- Local-only: Added browser caching via Cloudflare CDN to increase page loading speeds.
- Local-only:  Moved DNS lookup server to fault tolerant Cloudflare to prevent emergency downtimes (e.g. if a major earthquake hits local servers).
- Rename "In Progress" Speciality edit checkbox to "In Progress / Hidden"
- Moved open-source Github repository to "pathwaysmedical" from "warneboldt"

### Fixed

- User edit form now correctly places users into divisions.
- User edit form now disables HTML autocomplete.
- On Division edit pages, Internet Explorer browsers now correctly render specialty/city checkboxes in the local referral area table.
- Content Item pages now cache correctly so that different versions of the page are shown for admins and users.
- Referral form feedback button now disables during submission to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Error on referral form update

### Removed:
