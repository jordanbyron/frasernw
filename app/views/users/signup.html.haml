  %p.space.no_indent Please enter your e-mail address and then create and confirm a password, which will be what you use to log in to Pathways in the future. Note that once you complete this step and create your account, your access key will no longer be used: you will sign in only with your e-mail address and chosen password.

  %p.space.no_indent We will only ever use your e-mail address to send you important Pathways-related messages, such as a way to reset your password if you forget it.
